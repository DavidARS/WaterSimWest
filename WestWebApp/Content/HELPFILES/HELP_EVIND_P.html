<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557; font-size: 18px"><b>The Environment Sustainability Indicator</b> provides an indication of how well we are managing the riparian ecosystem along our riverine corridors. Sufficient water in the river helps to maintain healthy plant habitats and viable animal populations. If we use too much surface water, then less water is available for these plant and animal communities.
<br><br>
Many Cities and Towns use treated waste water (Reclaimed water, in this case) to enhance natural flows in our rivers. Thus, using too much Reclaimed water as a water source for Consumers will also negetatively impact the Environment; the Environment Indicator will reflect both the Surface Water and Reclaimed Water policy choices.
