<b>The Economy Sustainability</b> Indicator reflects how well the overall economy of your region fares as pertaining to your water resources.
<br><br>
The amount of water we consume and how we consume it affects the economy of our region. We can look at two examples. If we remove too much water from farming and agriculture
the agricultural sector shrinks (either fewer farms or less activity for each farm). This then reduces the profitability of farms (they cannot grow enough high-market crops to sell). If we do not have enough water for industry,
computer chip factories may re-locate or not move into your community as planned. This would be a loss of jobs for your region.
