<b>The Cities and Towns Efficiency of Water Use</b> Indicator demonstrates the overall net impact of policy choices on urban and rural water users. It encompasses a range of factors that include (to name a few)
comfort, lifestyle, and overall water use by residents and local businesses. <br><br>Cities and Towns water use in this case includes residential and non-residential use. Residential use can include irrigation of plants, trees, and yards,
swimming pools, cooking, bathing, and washing clothes. Non-residential use can include car washes, commercial water use (retail stores, bakeries, and restaurants), and irrigation of urban green space.
<br><br>
Using less water to maintain a similar lifestyle or service economy (efficiency) reduces waste and it lets more people live in your region without sacrificing your comfort or livelihood.
