<b>The Industry Efficiency of Water Use</b> Indicator represents how well your industrial players, such as mining, military and defence, health care, and tourism are doing in the future. <br><br>
Healthcare and Mining (for copper or coal), for example, are important economic engines for your community. They provide goods and services that sustain, or improve your well being while providing jobs for the community.
<br><br>
When you are too efficient, industries such as mining and material processing companies may find it difficult to remain in business because of the higher costs asssociated with highly efficient (Extreme) technologies. If you are not efficient enough you are using more water than necessary, jepodarizing the long-term sustainability of your communities water resources.
