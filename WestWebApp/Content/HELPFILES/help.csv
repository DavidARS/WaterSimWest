AGCON,Agricultural Water Conservation,"This policy control reduces the water demand for Agricltural Water Use. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no water conservation) to ""High"" which represents a 50% reduction in water use by the agriculture sector by the year 2065."
SINDAG,Agriculture Sustainability Indicator,The Agriculture Sustainability</b> Indicator represents how well your farming and agricultural neighbors (and perhaps you) are doing in the future.
COCLMADJ,Colorado River Climate Adjustment,"The Colorado River Climate Adjustment modifies the simulated flow on the Colorado River above Lake Powell. This control varies from 0 to 150%, with 100% equal to the historical estimate of river flow for the particular trace (period of record) chosen. Values greater than 100% increase the flows by the percentage chosen, while values less than 100% decrease the flows by the percentage chosen. For example, a value of 110% increases flows 10% above the historical estimate. Conversely, a value of 80% reduces flows by 20% of the historical estimate. "
CONSUME,Consumers of Water,"Depending on there you live, the dominant water use (consumed) for a region may be farms and agriculture, followed by cities and towns. Industry, and electric power generation facilities also consume water. For each of these sectors, less water may be used in a manner that still maintain the current population of a city or town, the same number of livestock, or perhaps the needs of industry. Using less water (while maintining the same population, number of livestock, or industrial output) means that you are being more efficient with your water use. For cities and towns this may be helped by installing duel flush toilets or low-flow shower heads. For farming this may be from installing drip irrigation methods for watering crops."
SINDECON,Economic Sustainablity Indicator,"The Economy Sustainability Indicator reflects how well the overall economy of your region fares as pertaining to your water resources. The amount of water we consume and how we consume it affects the economy of our region. We can look at two examples. If we remove too much water from farming and agriculture the agricultural sector shrinks (either fewer farms or less activity for each farm). This then reduces the profitability of farms (they cannot grow enough high-market crops to sell). If we do not have enough water for industry, computer chip factories may re-locate or not move into your community as planned. This would be a loss of jobs for your region."
SINDENV,Environment Sustainablity Indicator,"The Environment Sustainability Indicator reflects how well the natural environment has responded to the water available in the rivers. This include both the Colorado River and any local rivers that you have in your region. If we remove too much water from our rivers the riverine habitat suffers. This includes plants and animals that depend on that water. Arizona has the opportunity to be a leader in setting aside water for the environment. Although we need water for municipal and agricultural needs (and water for industry and power generation) we can satisfy the water needs for the environment while at the same time maintaining a healthy, growing community."
GWM,Ground Water Management,"This policy control alters the amount of groundwater available for each Use that has access to the groundwater sources. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no change in surface water supplies); ""Less"" which decreases the amount of groundwater by 20%; to ""High"" which represents a 20% increase in Groundwater that can be used."
SINDGR,Groundwater Sustainablity Indicator,"The Groundwater Sustainability Indicator provides a snapshot of future groundwater sustainability; are we pumping more water than we are recharging (unsustainable) or are we in balance? In many communities groundwater acts as a buffer, providing a reserve supply when other supplies are scarce. Pumping less groundwater now leaves more groundwater available for future use during drought or emergencies when surface water supplies are reduced. Thus, decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped increases the sustainability of the water supply."
ICON,Industrial Water,"This policy control alters the amount of water needed for industrial water users. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no water conservation) to ""High"" which represents a 50% reduction in Industrial water use by 2065."
IND,Industry,"Industry uses water to produce the goods and services that we all enjoy. Some examples of include copper mining, cement plants, and the fabrication of electronics. In all cases some water is used for industrial operations. In mining water is used to control silica dust in mines and in dust control in coarse crushing of ore. It is also used for drilling, sprinkling roads, and piles of loose ore prior to handling. Cement plants use water in the production of cement, and to clean and cool facility equipment. Much water is used in the production of semiconductors, miniaturized electronic circuits containing a multitude of transistors. Semiconductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water."
OTHERCLMADJ,Other Rivers Climate Adjustment,"The ""Other River Water"" Climate Adjustment modifies the simulated flow(s) on local rivers within your region. This control varies from 0 to 150%, with 100% equal to the historical estimate of river flow for the particular trace (period of record) chosen. Values greater than 100% increase the flows by the percentage chosen, while values less than 100% decrease the flows by the percentage chosen. For example, a value of 120% increases flows 20% above the historical estimate. Conversely, a value of 75% reduces flows by 25% of the historical estimate."
POWER,Power,"In the process of electrical generation (Power), water is consumed. The amount of water used per kilowatt-hour (a measure of electricity produced or consumed) produced depends on several factors. Depending on where you live the electricity used in your home and in your community - your power generation - may come from burning coal or natural gas. Or, perhaps it comes from hydroelectric (water moving through turbines because of gravity-from Lake Powell or Lake Mead) power or even a nuclear reactor (such as Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station West of the city of Phoenix). In all cases some water is used in the production of electricity. The amount of water used depends entirely on the type of power plant (or power generating station) in your community."
PCON,Power Water Conservation,"This policy control reduces the water demand for water by the Power Sector. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no water conservation) to ""High"" which represents a 50% reduction in water use for Power Production by the year 2065."
RECM,Reclaimed Water Management,"This policy control increases the amount of reclaimed (""recycled"") effluent from the Waste Water Treatment Plant that can be treated for use. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no change in surface water supplies) to ""High"" which represents an increase of water reclaimed, representing 20% of the total water demand (with more water demand comes more water available to be reclaimed)."
DROUSCEN,River Drought,"The user can impose a pre-defined drought effect on either the Colorado River or a local river in your region, or both. The current controls are defined as: 1) No Drought, 2) Abnormally Dry, 3) Moderate, and 4) Extreme. Abnormally Dry; the current drought stops in 2020 and the flows (starting in 2013) are reduced by 5% on the Colorado River and 15% on local Rivers,  Moderate; the current drougth stops in 2030. Flows on the Colorado River are reduced by 15% during this period. Flows on the local rivers in your region are reduced by 30%.  Extreme; the current drough stops in 2040, with flows on the Colorado river decreased by 40% while flows on local rivers are reduced by 65% during this period."
RUNBTN,Run Model,"The Run Model button activates the model to run for 50 years. The end result of the simulation is the future water supply and water demand (use) projections for the year 2050 for your region. After you alter the policies in an effort to bring the system into balance, or to improve the sustainability of your indicators, depress the run model button to see your new results."
SETBTN,Settings,"This settings button gives you access to additional user interface functionality: 1) you may change the region of interest, 2) print a report of the results from your last simulation, and 3) alter the drought effects on river flows for your region"
SOURCE,Sources Of Water,"Communities, farms (and agriculture), industry, and electric power generation facilities all use water. Of course cities and towns use water for drinking, bathing, watering the yard, and washing cars (to name a few). The farming and agricultural sector needs water for livestock and to irrigate crops (along with their household water use!) Industry uses water in the production of goods and services while the entities that create power for us all use water either in the generation of electricity or for cooling. Sources of water vary, depending on the community. You may have surface water from rivers and streams. You likely have groundwater from an aquifer deep within the ground. Or perhaps you have recycled (reclaimed) water from the water utility that serves your community.  The amount and availability of these sources varies from year to year and depends, to some extent, on climate."
SWM,Surface Water Management,"This policy control increases or decreases the amount of surface water available for each Use that has a surface water source. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no change in surface water supplies) to ""High"" which represents a 30% increase in Total Surface Water Available."
SIND,Sustainability Indicators,"The sustainability of a community may be evaluated using ""indicators""; the indicators presented here represent the future state of community values toward water supply and use. Each indicator represents a different aspect of water sustainability, but what is considered sustainable may vary from person to person. For example farmers may consider maximizing their access to water as essential for creating a sustainable food supply, but a manufacturer may consider maximizing their access to water as essential for a sustainable economy. Sustainable food supplies and a robust economy are both important to a community's over-all sustainability. Seeking what you consider an acceptable level of water system sustainability requires tradeoffs among these values. These indicators represent a snapshot of future sustainability as influenced by the values of the policy levers found below. Each policy lever will have a different impact on the indicators. The trade-offs between communities values as represented by the indicators will be based on the level of water use each of the policy choices present. There is no one clear ""right"" answer, rather each person or group will use the policy choices to seek what they consider to be an acceptable balance among the indicators based on their own community values. The value presented represents the final value (end of 2050) over the simulation period."
SINDURBAN,Urban Efficiency Sustainability Indicator,"The Urban Efficiency Sustainability Indicator demonstrates the overall net impact of policy choices on urban water users. It encompasses a range of factors that include (to name a few) comfort, lifestyle, and overall urban water use. Urban water use in this case includes residential and non-residential use. Residential use can include irrigation of plants, trees, and yards, swimming pools, cooking, bathing, and washing clothes. Non-residential use can include car washes, commercial water use (stores, bakeries, and restaurants), and irrigation of urban green space. Using less water to maintain a similar lifestyle or service (efficiency) reduces waste and it lets more people live in your region without sacrificing your comfort or livelihood."
UCON,Urban Water Conservation,"This policy control reduces the water demand for Urban Use. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from ""None"" (or no water conservation) to ""High"" which represents a 50% reduction in Urban water use by 2065."
