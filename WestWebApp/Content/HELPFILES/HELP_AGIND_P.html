<b>The Agriculture Efficiency of Water Use</b> Indicator represents how well your farming and agricultural neighbors (and perhaps you) are doing in the future.
<br><br>
Agriculture may account for anywhere from 50% to 80% of the total water used in your region. Farming and agriculture may be important economic engines for your community; certainly they are for Arizona as a whole. Reducing water used on farms and for agriculture could have a negitive impact on the economy of the community. Certainly it could mean fewer farms.
Even so, in the future, water currently used for farming and agriculture may instead need to be used to help meet the water needs of growing communities.
