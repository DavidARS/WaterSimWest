<b>The Groundwater Sustainability</b> Indicator provides a snapshot of future groundwater sustainability (in 2050); are we pumping more water than we are recharging (unsustainable) or are we in balance (groundwater pumping equals groundwater recharge)?
<br><br>In many communities groundwater acts as a buffer against shortfalls in surface water supplies, providing a reserve supply when other supplies are scarce. Pumping less groundwater now leaves more groundwater available for future
use during drought or emergencies when surface water supplies are reduced. Thus, decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped increases the sustainability of the water supply.
