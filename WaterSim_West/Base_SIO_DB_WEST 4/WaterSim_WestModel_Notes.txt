WaterSim West Model Notes
Initial Notes
Organization

WaterSim West is based on a heirarchy of classes that can be a bit confusing.  
Below are the classes for WaterSim brand models.  Those marked with a star are
generally stable classes, that have been used with a number of different models 
(Phoenix, America, and West) with no changes unique to each model.  However
there is a different WaterSimManager class for each model.

WaterSimManager_DB *
	'---------> WaterSimManager_SIO *
					'------- WaterSimManager
								'-------- WaterSimManagerClass *

WaterSimManager class for each model follows a similar structure and have the same 
enums and methods carried from WaterSimManagerClass, but there values and execution is
different for each model.  Each uniue WaterSimManager class wraps around a unique model.
In the West Model it is the WaterSimModel class.

in most VS projects thte WaterSimManager_DB, WaterSimManager_SIO, and WaterSimManagerClass files, as well as the classes
that support WaterSimManagerClass are found in a SourceFile directory common to all projects. These classes have changed very little 
and in order to keep these classes stable, they are kept in common to all projects.  However, WaterSimManager class 
files and some support methods for it are found in the project subdirectory.  These classes change frequently and often different projects 
are created to experiment and test different models. 

The WaterSimModel object the WaterSimManager encases (ie manages) is based on the Consumer Resource Framework (CRF).  
Each region in the WestModel has a WaterSimCRFModel that utilizes classes and methods in a CRF API.  The heart of 
the West Model is in the WaterSimCRFModel.  WaterSimModel contains a List<> of WaterSimCRFModel objects one for each region.
It manages the data initilization for the list of models and manages the interface between the list of model and WaterSimManager.  
There are different versions of the WaterSimCRF model being used to experiment and test different models.  However all these models are 
based on a standard set of classes called the CRF framework.  These files are stored in the same common surce directory mentioned above.  \
They have been used for multiple models (America, Initial Arizona, and West) and are fairly stable, not often changed.   
The WaterSimCRF model code is found in the Project directory.  The WaterSimModel must be able to pass through to WaterSimManager 
parameters to the List<> of WaterSimCRFModel objects, thus it changes with WaterSimCRFModel code and is also in the Project directory.

An effort was made to consolidate the WestModel into a new project to initialize contonued work on the West Model. Also some better 
documentation was started for the WaterSim West model.
